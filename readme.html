<h2>Getting Started: A 5-Minute Installation</h2>
<p>Starting with Random Cats is quick and easy:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Download the package and unzip it into an empty directory.</li>
    <li>Open the <a href="path/wp-admin/install.php">install.php</a> file in your browser. It will guide you through setting up a <code>wp-config.php</code> file with your database connection details.</li>
    <li>If, for any reason, this doesn't work, don't worry. You can manually configure the <code>wp-config.php</code> file by copying the details from <code>wp-config-sample.php</code>.</li>
    <li>Once your configuration is set up, the installer will create the necessary tables for your site. If any errors occur, please visit the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forums/">WordPress support forums</a> with as much information as possible.</li>
    <li>After setup, the installer will take you to the <a href="path/wp-login.php">login page</a>. You can sign in using the username and password you provided during installation. If a password was generated for you, you can change it in your profile settings.</li>
